abck cookie harvester. only works when there isnt a queue.

download and extract everything to a folder of your choice:\n
run 'npm install'\n
run 'npm start'\n
run python script (ide, cmd, your call)\n

it will save cookies to a cookies.json
if you have proxies, load it into proxies.txt
this will help harvesting rate as it is capped at 10 cookies per min per ip
