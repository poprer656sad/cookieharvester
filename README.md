abck cookie harvester. only works when there isnt a queue.

download and extract everything to a folder of your choice:

run 'npm install'

run 'npm start'

run python script (ide, cmd, your call)

it will save cookies to a cookies.json
if you have proxies, load it into proxies.txt
this will help harvesting rate as it is capped at 10 cookies per min per ip
